This is a Markdown previewer project using React, Bootstrap and SASS.
This is the second project to get the FreeCodeCamp Frontend libraries certification.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer

I am using the npx-create-react-app command to set-up a template for the project.
